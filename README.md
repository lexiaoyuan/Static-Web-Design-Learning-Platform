# Static-Web-Design-Learning-Platform
>A platform based on HTML and CSS, of course, now only a few pages, these pages initially determine the functions of the platform. In addition, this platform is only a small exercise of learning and using the front-end knowledge. I also do it while learning. So there are many deficiencies in the front-end pages of this platform. I will gradually improve in the follow-up process of gradual learning. The main purpose of developing and designing this platform is to practice and familiarize with the front-end knowledge learned, and to be able to flexibly apply these knowledge to achieve some functions.
